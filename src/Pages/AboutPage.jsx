                    <h3>My journey into programming began with curiosity and perseverance. Until my higher studies, I had no prior exposure to coding. I started with C programming, which initially challenged me but helped me build a strong foundation in logic and problem-solving. I later moved on to Java, further strengthening my understanding of core programming concepts.</h3>

                       As I discovered web development, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and realized that real growth comes from building, not just watching tutorials. This led me to modern frontend development with React, where I learned to create dynamic, component-based user interfaces. To complement this, I explored backend technologies like Node.js and Express.js, gaining an understanding of APIs, server-side logic, and full-stack application flow. Today, I focus on building full-stack projects that turn ideas into real-world solutions, continuously learning by experimenting, solving problems, and improving my craft.
